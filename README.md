# Social-book

## About
Social-book is a simple front-end clone of Facebook that I built to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a static project (no backend) that focuses on layout, responsive design, and basic client-side interactions like posting, liking (UI only), and simple form handling.

This repo is meant for learning and demonstration purposes only.

## Features
- Home feed layout similar to a basic social network
- Post creation form (client-side only)
- Basic like/unlike UI interactions (no persistence)
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Static assets organized in an `images/` folder

## Tech
- HTML5
- CSS3 (flexbox / grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

## How to use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure the `images/` folder stays next to `index.html` so image paths work correctly.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (desktop or mobile). No build step required.

If you want to host it online, you can enable GitHub Pages:
1. Go to the repository Settings → Pages.
2. Set the source to the `main` branch and folder to `/ (root)`.
3. Save; your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/Social-book` after a few minutes.

## Folder structure
- index.html — main entry
-style.css — stylesheets
- script.js — JavaScript files
- images/ — image files used by the site
- README.md — this file

## Notes and tips
- Paths are case-sensitive. Make sure image filenames and references in the HTML match exactly.
- This project does not store or send any user data. All actions are simulated in the browser and reset on page reload.
- If images do not appear, confirm they are uploaded to the `images/` folder in the repo and that the file names match.
